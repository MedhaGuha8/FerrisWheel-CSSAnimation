This project showcases a CSS-animated Ferris Wheel with dynamically color-changing cars, demonstrating the creative use of HTML5 and CSS3 to create visually stunning and interactive animations. The Ferris Wheel spins 
smoothly, replicating the charm of a carnival ride, while its cars change color as they rotate, adding an engaging visual effect.
